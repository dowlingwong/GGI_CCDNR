# This is a public repo for the student project: Dark Matter: Theory meets detection school at GGI
## Introduction
The goal of these projects is to go from data to theory, reflecting the school’s
motto: “Theory meets experiment”. We will give you data from 4 different
experimental searches (3 of the datasets are simulated), which contain a signal
that is not due to known backgrounds.
